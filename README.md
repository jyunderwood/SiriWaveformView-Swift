# WaveformView iOS

A UIView subclass, in Swift, that reproduces the waveform effect seen in Siri on iOS 7 and 8.

Originally a Swift and iOS port of [SISinusWaveView](https://github.com/raffael/SISinusWaveView) that also removed the requirement of `EZAudio`. There is also a [WaveformView for macOS](https://github.com/jyunderwood/WaveformView-macOS) that shares most of the same code. This project includes a simple demo application but it's also used in the example application [Talkboy for iOS](https://github.com/jyunderwood/Talkboy-iOS).

## Install via Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

## Install via Swift Package Manager

Open Xcode and Select from menu to `File > Swift Packages > Add Package Depende`.

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate WaveformView into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "jyunderwood/WaveformView-iOS" ~> 2.0
```

Then follow the [iOS building instructions](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos) in the Carthage README.
